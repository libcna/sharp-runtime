# Audit: `modules/collections/tests/System/Collections/Generic/QueuePriorityOrderedTests.cpp`

## Metadata

- Audit status: AUDITED.
- Component: `Collections.Core`.
- Validation: `gmake -C build -j4 SharpRuntimeTests_Collections_Core && build/SharpRuntimeTests_Collections_Core --gtest_color=no` passed 1,422/1,422 on 2026-07-27.
- Scope: source, immediate call sites, and the focused test surface were reviewed; this is audit-only evidence with no production or test-source modification.

## Assessment

The focused test source was reviewed against normal and negative-path contracts.  It passes as part of the 1,422-test Collections.Core target but leaves the adjacent audited findings without the stated regression assertions.

## Missing assertions and diagnostics

- Keep invalid-input, lifecycle, ownership, and native-boundary diagnostics covered by focused tests as this surface evolves.

## Final assessment

AUDITED. No separate evidence-backed finding is assigned to this file.
