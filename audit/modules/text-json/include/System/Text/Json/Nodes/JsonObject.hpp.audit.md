# Audit: `modules/text-json/include/System/Text/Json/Nodes/JsonObject.hpp`

## Metadata

- Audit status: AUDITED.
- Component: `Text.Json`.
- Evidence: focused `SharpRuntimeTests_Text_Json` passed 147/147; direct behavior probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/text_json_probe.cpp`; node-lifetime ASan/UBSan probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/node_lifetime.cpp` where applicable.

## SR-AUD-327 — high — JsonNode children retain dangling raw parent pointers after parent destruction

JsonObject has the same shared-child/raw-parent ownership mismatch as JsonArray; it needs destruction/lifetime handling before a retained child traverses its parent.

## Assessment

Object lookup, duplicate-name checks, replacement, removal, ordering, and child ownership were reviewed.

## Missing assertions and diagnostics

The reviewed surface should retain exact-result, malformed-input, lifetime, and error-path assertions appropriate to its public contract.

## Final assessment

AUDITED; evidence is recorded at component scope. Confirmed finding links above require evidence-backed remediation after the audit phase.
