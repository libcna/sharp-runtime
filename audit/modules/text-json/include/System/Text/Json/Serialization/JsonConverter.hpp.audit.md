# Audit: `modules/text-json/include/System/Text/Json/Serialization/JsonConverter.hpp`

## Metadata

- Audit status: AUDITED.
- Component: `Text.Json`.
- Evidence: focused `SharpRuntimeTests_Text_Json` passed 147/147; direct behavior probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/text_json_probe.cpp`; node-lifetime ASan/UBSan probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/node_lifetime.cpp` where applicable.

## Assessment

The DOM-based converter adaptation and its explicit absence of reflection Type parameters are documented and tested through a concrete converter.

## Missing assertions and diagnostics

Keep explicit behavioral tests for every supported non-reflection adapter and distinguish documented reflection limitations from parser-policy regressions.

## Final assessment

AUDITED; evidence is recorded at component scope.
