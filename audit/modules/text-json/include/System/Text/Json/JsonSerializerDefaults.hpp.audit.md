# Audit: `modules/text-json/include/System/Text/Json/JsonSerializerDefaults.hpp`

## Metadata

- Audit status: AUDITED.
- Component: `Text.Json`.
- Evidence: focused `SharpRuntimeTests_Text_Json` passed 147/147; direct behavior probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/text_json_probe.cpp`; node-lifetime ASan/UBSan probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/node_lifetime.cpp` where applicable.

## Assessment

The three public enum values and their option-constructor mapping were reviewed. Strict option initialization is tested, but effectiveness is covered by the serializer-options finding where relevant.

## Missing assertions and diagnostics

The reviewed surface should retain exact-result, malformed-input, lifetime, and error-path assertions appropriate to its public contract.

## Final assessment

AUDITED; evidence is recorded at component scope.
