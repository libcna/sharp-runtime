# Audit: `modules/text-json/src/System/Text/Json/Nodes/JsonNode.cpp`

## Metadata

- Audit status: AUDITED.
- Component: `Text.Json`.
- Evidence: focused `SharpRuntimeTests_Text_Json` passed 147/147; direct behavior probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/text_json_probe.cpp`; node-lifetime ASan/UBSan probe at `/tmp/sharp-runtime-text-json-audit/node_lifetime.cpp` where applicable.

## SR-AUD-327 — high — JsonNode children retain dangling raw parent pointers after parent destruction

AssignParent installs raw parent links while no destruction path detaches children. The ASan reproduction retains a child, destroys its JsonArray parent, then reports UAF in getRootProperty.

## Assessment

Node parent assignment, type casts, JSON conversion, parsing, and clone support were reviewed.

## Missing assertions and diagnostics

The reviewed surface should retain exact-result, malformed-input, lifetime, and error-path assertions appropriate to its public contract.

## Final assessment

AUDITED; evidence is recorded at component scope. Confirmed finding links above require evidence-backed remediation after the audit phase.
